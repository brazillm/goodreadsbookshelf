# Goodreads.com, "My Books" Page Redesign
# Creative Brief
## Brazill Design Group

###  Background
Goodreads is an Amazon company and "social cataloging" headquartered in San Francisco, CA. The website was launched in January 2007 by Otis Chandler, II, a software engineer and entrepreneur, and Elizabeth Chandler. Goodreads allows individuals to freely search their extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists. They can also create their own groups of book suggestions, surveys/polls, blogs, and discussions.

According to Mr. Chandler, Goodread's  is "a place where you can see what your friends are reading and vice versa. You can create "bookshelves" to organize what you've read (or want to read). You can comment on each other's reviews. You can find your next favorite book. And on this journey with your friends you can explore new territory, gather information, and expand your mind. "  

According to their "about" page, Goodreads boasts 50 million members with 50 million reviews and 1.5 billion books added since the site launch. This makes it by far the largest social book site of its kind.  

### Objective 
The primary objective of the project is to unclutter and organize the "My Books" section of the Goodreads site. User feedback reveals that this page can be intimidating and confusing for less tech-savy readers.  Streamlining the page will create a more welcoming experience for new uses and will improve navagation for all. 

### Target Audience
Research shows that Goodreads users are primarily college-educated, white women between the ages of 25-44 with an income under $50k per year living in the U.S.  These women work hard juggling careers, family, volunteer projects and social commitments. Reading is their way to relax and enjoy a few prescious hours per week for themselves. They like the idea of bookclubs, but don't necessarily have the time to commit to a local group. Logging onto Goodreads puts them in touch with friendly people who share their love of reading, but on a more convenient timetable. Their lives are busy enough, they don't need their favorite book site be. 

###Focus Statement
Your lives are busy enough, your favorite book site shouldn't be. 

###Selling Features
1. The three major categories, "Read", "Reading" and "Want to Read" will now have their own shelves. That way users can easily tell what books are in each category at quick glance.  
2. No one goes into a bookstore or library expecting to see a Southern cookbook sitting next to a James Patterson novel, yet that's what new users see when they start categorizing their collections and wish-lists. The new page will use Goodreads'advanced API to keep fiction with fiction, self-help with self-help, Sci-fi with sci-fi etc.  
3. Users will not be bombarded with endless categorization tools. Much of the tools will be hidden in dropdown bars, waiting to be used at the user's convenience.  
4. The new web page will be responsive to both desktop and mobile viewing, eliminating the need for a seperate downloadable app.  

###Schedule. 
Brazill Design Group (BDG) will research, design and test a new, responsive "My Books" page by December 1, 2016. 
BDG will consult with Goodread's creative team on a weekly basis, providing initial mockups by Aug 30, followed by test group data and working prototypes by October 15.
